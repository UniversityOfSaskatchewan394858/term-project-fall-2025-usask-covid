Application Description:
    Our ABM Model simulates the spread of an infection for students at the University of Saskatchewan.

    We simulate the effects of several interventions counteracting disease spread:
        CommunitySpaces vs. NoCommunitySpaces,
        Masking vs. NoMasking,
        SymptomaticIsolation vs. NoSymptomaticIsolation,
        Testing vs. NoTesting,
        AllInterventions vs. NoInterventions, and more

Application Files:
    Usask-Covid-v1.3.alp
    usask-map.png

Setup Steps:
    Run the Usask-Covid-v1.3.alp using AnyLogic version 8.9.6.
    Ensure that the usask-map.png is in the same file directory.
    Run each simulation to see the intervention effects on infection spread!
